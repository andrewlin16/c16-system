Proposal:

I will be building a simple computer system on the FPGA, including a simple
processor, video chip, and sound chip. The processor will use either the c16 ISA
we've built on in class or possibly my own simple RISC-type ISA, and it will be
at least a basic pipelined processor in terms of complexity. The video chip will
probably use simple tile-based graphics and will utilize the HDMI port on our
boards. The sound chip will generate and mix simple sound waves and output
through the board's audio output port. To be able to utilize the video and sound
chips, the processor will interface with the chips through memory-mapped I/O,
and the processor will need interrupt support to utilize the chips well.
