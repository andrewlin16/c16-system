Memory-mapped I/O:

Main memory is 0x0000-0x1FFF. Everything memory-mapped is accessible at
0x8000-0xFFFF.

Load: read board inputs (switches and keys)
-10XX XXXX XXXX XXX0 (0x8000): switches
-10XX XXXX XXXX XXX1 (0x8001): keys

Store: write to sound or video registers
-110X XXXX XXXX ccpp (0xC000-0xC00F): sound registers
	-c: channel select
	-p: param select
		-00: period (16-bit)
		-01: volume (5-bit)
		-10: width/mode (3-bit)
-111p piii iiii iiii (0xE000-0xFFFF): video registers
	-p: param select
		-00: palette color definitions (12-bit values, 16 addresses (4-bit))
		-01: tile definitions (64-bit values, 64 addresses (6-bit), or 256
		16-bit values)
		-10: palette map (8-bit values, 1200 addresses (11-bit))
		-11: tile map (6-bit values, 1200 addresses (11-bit))
	-i: index select

(Note: these mappings are more strict than they actually are implented. For
example, bit 14 is only designated in design so that the input space doesn't
overlap with the output space. In implementation, load/store doesn't even look
at bit 14.)
